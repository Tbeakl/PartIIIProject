# How the full trace (1616) is broken down

# The first 1600 are from the 20 rounds, so that is 80 per round and 20 per quarter round

# Inside a quarter round is broken into 4 parts
# The add has a single part in the trace
# The exclusive-or also has a single part in the trace
# The rotation has three in the trace but I think that only the final should be used
# because that is more fundamental to the actual algorithm

# Last 16 elements from the addition afterwards
